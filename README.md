This code and hardware were simulated and validated on Proteus. Make sure when uploading the code to arduino, you have selected UNO.

In the serial monitor, input:
- 1, for regular mode
- 2, for pedestrian mode
- 3, for night mode

The threshold for the light intensity for night mode couldn't be determined because the circuit was simulated, and not built on actual hardware, so you'd have to
check the intensity yourself. The threshold in the code is by default set to 500.
